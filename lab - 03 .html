    <p>A Great Motivational Quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure. And the sooner<br> you realize that, you accept that, and integrate that into your work ethic. You will start being<br> successful. As long as you blame others for the reason you arenâ€™t where you want to be, you will<br> always be a failure.</p> </blockquote>
